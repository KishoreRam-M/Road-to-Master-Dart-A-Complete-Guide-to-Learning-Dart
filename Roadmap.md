## *🟢 1. Dart Fundamentals (Beginner)*
✅ *Syntax & Basics*  
🔹 Variables (var, final, const, late)  
🔹 Data types (int, double, String, bool, List, Map)  
🔹 Type inference (var, dynamic, Object)  
🔹 Operators (+, -, *, /, ??, ??=, !, ?., as, is)  
🔹 String interpolation ("Hello, $name")  

✅ *Control Flow*  
🔹 if-else, switch-case, ternary operator  
🔹 Loops (for, while, do-while, forEach)  

✅ *Functions*  
🔹 Positional & named parameters  
🔹 Optional parameters  
🔹 Arrow functions (=>)  
🔹 Function as a first-class object

## *🟠 2. Intermediate Dart*
✅ *Collections & Iterables*  
🔹 List, Set, Map, Queue  
🔹 List methods (map, where, reduce, fold)  
🔹 forEach(), .first, .last, .contains(), .remove()  

✅ *Exception Handling*  
🔹 try-catch, on, finally, throw  

✅ *OOP (Object-Oriented Programming)*  
🔹 Classes & Objects  
🔹 Constructor types (default, named, factory)  
🔹 Inheritance (extends)  
🔹 Method overriding (@override)  
🔹 Interfaces & abstract classes  
🔹 this, super, static  

✅ *Enums & Extensions*  
🔹 enum (for defining constants)  
🔹 extension (add methods to existing classes)  

✅ *Generics*  
🔹 List<T>, Map<K, V>  
🔹 Custom generic classes  

---

## *🔴 3. Advanced Dart*
✅ *Asynchronous Programming*  
🔹 Future, async-await, then(), catchError()  
🔹 Stream, StreamSubscription  
🔹 Handling API calls (http package)  

✅ *Isolates & Concurrency*  
🔹 compute() function for multithreading  
🔹 Spawning new Isolates  

✅ *Mixin & Meta-Programming*  
🔹 mixin (multiple inheritance)  
🔹 Reflection with dart:mirrors  

✅ *Dependency Injection*  
🔹 Using providers like GetIt, Provider  

✅ *Unit Testing*  
🔹 Writing tests with test package  
🔹 Mocking dependencies  

✅ *Dart FFI (Foreign Function Interface)*  
🔹 Calling C/C++ code from Dart  

---

## *🎯 4. Dart for Flutter Development*
✅ *Flutter-Specific Dart Features*  
🔹 BuildContext, StatefulWidget, StatelessWidget  
🔹 setState(), initState(), dispose()  
🔹 Handling user inputs  
🔹 Working with JSON (dart:convert)  

✅ *State Management*  
🔹 Provider, Riverpod, Bloc, GetX  

✅ *Working with Databases*  
🔹 SQLite (sqflite), Firebase, Hive  

✅ *Networking in Flutter*  
🔹 Fetching API data (http package)  
🔹 WebSockets for real-time apps
