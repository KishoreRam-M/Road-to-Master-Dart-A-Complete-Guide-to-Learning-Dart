The `assert` method in Dart is used for **debugging purposes** to test conditions during development. It helps you ensure that certain conditions hold true at runtime, and if they don't, it throws an exception to alert you about the failure.

### How It Works:
- `assert` takes a **boolean expression** as its argument. If the expression evaluates to `true`, the program continues executing normally. 
- If the expression evaluates to `false`, an `AssertionError` is thrown, which stops the execution of the program and provides information about the failed condition.

### Syntax:
```dart
assert(condition);
```

- **condition**: A boolean expression that you want to check.
- If the condition is **false**, the program will throw an `AssertionError`.

### Example:
```dart
void main() {
  int age = 25;
  assert(age >= 18); // This condition will pass (because age is 25)
  
  int number = 5;
  assert(number == 10); // This will fail because 5 is not equal to 10
}
```

In the example above:
- The first `assert(age >= 18)` passes, because `age` is 25, which is greater than or equal to 18.
- The second `assert(number == 10)` fails, because `number` is 5, not 10, and an `AssertionError` is thrown.

### Notes:
- **During Development**: Assertions are typically used in development mode to catch bugs early. If an assertion fails, it helps you identify problems in your code quickly.
- **In Production**: Assertions are ignored in production code. In Dart, assertions are only enabled in **debug mode** (when running in development), but not in **release mode**.

### Using `assert` with messages:
You can also add a message to be displayed if the assertion fails:
```dart
int number = 5;
assert(number == 10, 'The number must be 10!');
```
If `number` is not equal to 10, the message `'The number must be 10!'` will be printed along with the error.

### Conclusion:
- **Purpose**: To help developers catch logical errors early by testing assumptions during development.
- **Behavior**: Only active in debug mode and ignored in production.
